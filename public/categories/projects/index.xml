      <description>A magic square is an n x n square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range 1,2,…,n^2 such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. An example is shown in the picture below.
 There are multiple ways to create such squares. I’m presenting the code that constructs magic squares for any odd value of n and displays them for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13.</description>
